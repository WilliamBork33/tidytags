Simple Collection and Powerful Analysis of Twitter Data

## Overview

The goal of **tidytags** is to sync together (a) the simplicity of collecting tweets over time with a [Twitter Archiving Google Sheet](https://tags.hawksey.info/) (TAGS), (b) the utility of the [rtweet package](https://rtweet.info/) for processing and preparing additional Twitter metadata, and (c) a collection of different analytic functions we have developed during our own social media research. 

## Installation

Soon, you will be able to install the released version of **tidytags** from [CRAN](https://CRAN.R-project.org) with:

```{r cran-installation, eval=FALSE}
#install.packages("tidytags")
```

You can also install the development version of **tidytags** from GitHub with:

```{r gh-installation, eval=FALSE}
install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("bretsw/tidytags")
```

## Usage

### read_tags()

At its most basic level, **tidytags** allows you to work with a [Twitter Archiving Google Sheet](https://tags.hawksey.info/) (TAGS) in R. This is done with the [googlesheets package](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/googlesheets/vignettes/basic-usage.html). One requirement for using the **googlesheets** package is that your TAGS has been published to the web. To do this, with the TAGS page open in a browser, go to `File` >> `Publish to the web`. The `Link` field should be 'Entire document' and the `Embed` field should be 'Web page.' If everything looks right, then click the `Publish` button. Next, click the `Share` button in the top right corner of the Google Sheets window, select `Get shareable link`, and set the permissions to 'Anyone with the link can view.' Now you should be ready to go.

At this point you can view or read your TAGS archive into R using `read_tags()`.

### pull_tweet_data()

With TAGS imported into R, **tidytags** allows you to gather quite a bit more information related to the collected tweets with the `pull_tweet_data()`. This function uses the [rtweet package](https://rtweet.info/) to query the Twitter API. Using **rtweet** requires a Twitter developer account; see the rtweet vignette [Obtaining and using access tokens](https://rtweet.info/articles/auth.html) as guide to get started. 

(b) the utility of the [rtweet package](https://rtweet.info/) for processing and preparing additional Twitter metadata, and (c) a collection of different analytic functions we have developed during our own social media research.

## Getting help

**tidytags** is still a work in progress, so we fully expect that there are still some bugs to work out and functions to document better.
