\title{Get tweet ID numbers as character strings}
\usage{
get_char_tweet_ids(df)
}
\arguments{
\item{df}{A dataframe of containing the column name 'status_url'
(i.e., the hyperlink to specific tweets)}
}
\value{
A list or vector of tweet IDs as character strings
}
\description{
This function is useful because Google Sheets (and hence TAGS)
  typically round very large numbers into an exponential form. Thus,
  because tweet ID numbers are very large, they often get corrupted in this
  rounding process. The most reliable way to get full tweet ID numbers is by
  using this function, \code{get_char_tweet_ids()}, to pull the ID numbers from
  the URL linking to specific tweets.
